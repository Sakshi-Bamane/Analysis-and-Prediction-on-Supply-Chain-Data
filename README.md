# 📦 Late Delivery Risk Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

Late deliveries can negatively impact customer satisfaction and business performance.
This project aims to predict the risk of late deliveries using data analysis and machine learning techniques.
The model helps businesses identify high-risk orders in advance and take preventive actions.

## 🎯 Objective
